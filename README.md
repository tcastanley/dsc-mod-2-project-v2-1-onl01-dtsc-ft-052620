# King County Housing Market - Green Build Subsidy Analysis & Recommendations

### Dataset - King County House Sales (over 21,000 Records!) https://www.kaggle.com/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction

## Purpose of Analysis
The KC Municipality has proposed a bill to provide a Green Build Housing Subsidy for qualifying new-builds and 
renovations in cities with low-activity housing markets. The purpose of the subsidy is to encourage residential retention 
and environmental sustainability while supporting the local economy.

### Objective:
The KC Assessors Office has been tasked with providing pilot testing recommendations regarding ‘Where’ and ‘How’ these 
subsidies are to be granted.

## Questions
#### 1. What are the top 5 lowest activity cities?
#### 2. How do city housing conditions and grades influence qualification?
#### 3. Should subsidy amounts differ based on the build-type?

## Recommendations
### Question 1. 
#### The determination of ‘low-activity’ housing markets can be viewed in two different lights:
#### -Objective housing sales per city or;
#### -Housing sales per capita per city.

### Question 2 & 3
#### The data has shown that there is a difference in market values for new-build homes versus renovated homes.  However, the differences between the two can vary greatly depending on the average condition and grade of homes per city.

## Future Work
#### 1. More information about local economies & construction costs to determine if subsidy would be an effective incentive.
#### 2.  Local environmental concerns, as they likely vary widely throughout the county.
